What should I do about parameter handling?

    Issues:
        * user may set parameters as flattened parameters or unflattened parameters
        * accessor maps to parameter by name whose name wont match if params have been flattened
        * general confusion and the now obvious lacking-need for treating params and fields as seperate
    
    Solutions:
        * use fields directly (as parameters)
        * use the value directive (or create a new one) to store the submitted data
        * keep parameters interface but have it access the fields "submitted data" directive
        * dont accept params() argument to new()
        * make flatten_params() and unflatten_params() the only means for serialization
